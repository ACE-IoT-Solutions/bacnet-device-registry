The application uses SQLite for storing and managing the devices' IDs, network addresses, and network numbers.

## Usage

The following endpoints are available:

-   `GET /devices/`: Get a list of all devices.
-   `GET /devices/{device_id}`: Get a device with the specified ID.
-   `PUT /devices/{device_id}`: Update the network address and network number of an existing device with the specified ID.
